Robotics & AI Engineer | Building Intelligent Autonomous Systems | Computer Vision 

I'm a Robotics and AI Engineer passionate about designing smart, autonomous systems that think, learn, and move. With a strong foundation in machine learning, control systems, and real-time robotics software (ROS, Python, C++), I bridge the gap between intelligent algorithms and real-world robots.

Whether it's deploying a swarm of robots, fine-tuning neural networks for perception, or writing motion planning algorithms that navigate the unknown, I thrive at the intersection of code, circuits, and creativity. I believe the future is autonomous—and I’m here to engineer it.
